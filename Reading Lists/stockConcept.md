# Ideas coming out of stock concept reading:

**GOAL: stock concept ------> complexes for MS HBSA model**

**Schema: Pacific Salmon Comission,** a multi-stock, multi-species fishery that manages removals for several stock complexes simultaneously. FIND LITERATURE. **Simon and Larkin, 1972: The stock concept in Pacific salmon** seems like a good place to start.

- Stock (as defined by Booke (1981):
    + General definition: Species group or population of fish that maintains and sustains itself over time
    + Precise definition: a population of fish maintaining and sustaining Castle-Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
    + If genetic basis is not available for stock characterisation, then phenotypic stock definition has to be recognised as a population of fish maintaining characteristics which are expressed in one or more ways.
- Later, Booke (1999) argues for the inclusion of habitat in the definition, as a way of helping to define stocks - can we use it to help define discrete stocks or build complexes in our case?
- Stock (defined by Ihssen et al, 1981): an intraspecific group of randomly mating individuals with spatial or temporal integrity
- Measuring such things in the case of a multispecies fishery is difficult, especially given resources (data-limited nature of some stocks) - although there is a lot of data from ASOPs
    + Is it better to argue for stock complexes in the case of data poverty, and bypass the single stock concept entirely? 
        * Define complexes based on local knowledge of discrete stocks of a subset of all species, technical interactions of stocks in the same area and fishery dynamics
        * Read up on strategy vs tactics - will these define two different complex types?
    + Maybe we can use an ensemble (holistic, Begg 1999) approach, or mine the literature for these approaches to define our base "stocks" correctly:
        * Are we interested in distinct, genetic stocks or management units?
    - ~~Are we going to come across any allopatric (different geographic area) stocks at all? Probably not, as there are no physical barriers to mixing.~~
    - Fishing applies stresses that make it easier to define stocks from population parameters (Ihssen et al, 1981), perhaps this will help us to uncover complexes from ASOP data.
    - Can we use existing data on population parameters, combined with mark-recapture studies, to confirm existing stock definitions and (re)define missing or inappropriate stock concepts?
        + Remember that any defined stock must be recognisable by a trained observer with little error - or it must be robust to noise in composition estimates from survey samples.
        * Mark recapture is inappropriate for rockfish - what can we do instead?
        * Can we use environmental factors (temperature etc) to help define both stocks and complexes?
        * Is there existing morphometric/meristic data that we can use to define our stock concept? Ihssen et al (1981) say probably not because no study has been done establishing a link between mophology/meristics and genetic distinctness of stocks. Perhaps this has changed in ~34 years.
        * Existing osseology and osteology? New stuff is costly.
- Read over Ashleen's thesis section on stock concept again. And again.
    + References Begg et al for early definitions, but mentions over 100 years of interest and labour in stock identification **READ HJORT 1914**
    + Recent definitions admit that a stock is largely a construct of management (operationally defined, according to Cadrin and Secor 2013 etc)
    + Walters (1987) and Ricker (1973) warnings about overfishing lower productivity populations, even though recruitment function appears to show increasing productivity, leading to increased exploitation, due to increasing average.
    + Punt 2006: spatial and multispecies interactions are rarely explicitly incorporated into biological models (in fact, we don't do intend to do so either, but use the statistical model to infer it)
    + Majority of stock identification research demonstrates a clear definition for stock definitions that are based on genetic evidence of differentiation (Cadrin and Secor, 2009) +1
    + Ironic to note that genetic infomation is seldom formally integrated into fisheries management (Waples et al, 2008) - *my guess is that stocks are, as usual, operationally defined*
    + Not surprisingly, stocks are defined reflecting the historical objectives of maximising short term yield within a given spatial area (Jennings et al, 2001)
    + Mis-matches between management and biological scale are common, appear to be contributing to collapse - existing stock definitions are insufficient.
    + demographic - not genetic - independence is the key assumption underlying fisheries management (stock assessment dynamics are driven primarily by local demographic processes of birth/death, not by exchange) (Palsboll et al, 2007) - *does this mean that shared life history parameters are the key - regardless of reproductive isolation?*
        * holistic approach/solution to stock identification that integrates a variety of types of information - this is mentioned in one of the 1999 papers!!
        * Rate of mixing is the critical feature of stock definition
            - 10% mixing rate (?) proposed as the point at which stocks switch from demographically independent to dependent
            - 5 - 10 %
- Question: What is the appropriate definition of a management unit in a multispecies fishery? Should we manage species as a single stock, or complexes of mixed stocks. Should we manage the fishery as a collection of single stocks, or manage portfolios/assemblages of several stocks, or even portfolios of complexes? Should we aggregate areas, or disaggregate stocks over areas?
    - What is the best definition/concept of stock to use? Begg and Waldman's (1999) semi-discrete groups of fish with some definable attributes of interest to managers.
    - Booke (1999) argues that any concept can be applied as long as the markers that are used are inherited and can define a fish group plus its habitat. Requires a genetic marker.
    - Secor: divergent migration behaviours or habitat use within populations (contingents <- sub-population?) a more useful definition?
- Aggregation thinking (from Ecosystem dynamics, Sughihara et al):
    + (pp 136 - 139) Reread material on Aggregation theory: what we do is slightly different, since we're not really aggregating multiple species, just aggregating their statistical models hierarchically. This allows us to sidestep a lot of the problems with non-linear active/passive agg functions.
    + Need to think about how to deal with sub-pops of the same species: do these get aggregated depending on genetics? Is this even a good idea (Benson says 10% mixing is enough to remove genetic distinctness)
    + (p140) **"... Lange-Hicks condition... *variables that move together may be combined "error-free" into a single variable*... Thus, species that remain in constant proportion to each other over some time interval may be treated as one ... eg, reasonable first approximation may be to lump together species that have been disturbed more or less proportionately (similar patterns of F). These patterns might be defined set theoretically by the multiplicity of fishing gear to which each species is exposed."** <- ***Starting point for aggregation study***
    + *Aggregation in Shaefer model: scaling*: Sugihara writes about clustering together multiple species in a hand-line fishery based on depth. Clusters had no significant interaction between them, and the fit of the model at the cluster level was improved by negative interactions within each cluster group due to competition and substituability. With other gear types which catch multiple individuals on a set, this might not be the case...
    + (pp 141-142)**Understand this passage**Lange-Hicks criterion wrt cluster groups: Concept of components moving together is model specific. In the Shaefer model, the idea of components moving together applies to how the equilibria move as fishing effort changes. Thus species which may be competitors but which are *perfect substitutes* as far as the fishery is concerned may be lumped for this analysis because their equilibria move together.
    + **Topological organisations...** ...potential competitive interactions tend to be localised into numerous small guilds/cliques <- ***competition assemblages?*** 
- New approach to stock identification (Dizon et al, 92)
    + Simple genetics is insufficient (Benson said this)
    + ESU might be the best approach, but in practic it is a difficult task to define a stock based on principles of genetic uniqueness
    + Suggest defining stock based on information categorised as
        * distributional
        * population response
        * phenotypic
        * genotypic
    + Reminds me of the Holistic approach recommended by Begg et al.
