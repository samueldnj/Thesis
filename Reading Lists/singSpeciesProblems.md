## Notes
1. Walters et al, 2005:
- Abstract: widespread application of single species MSY policies would in general cause severe deterioration in ecosystem structure... loss of top predators
    + forage species support piscivores
- Intro lists a few issues of applying single-species assessment predictions in ecosystems:
    + Appropriation of production by fisheries that would otherwise support valued predators
    + Widespread degradation in ecosystem function, considerably smaller overall yield and value than what would be predicted from the sum of corresponding single-species yields (MSY)
    + 
- Focus on trophic effects from single species management
2. Hollowed et al:
- More of a review of contemporary MS models, less of a critique of SS models.
3.  Pauly et al, 2000:
- Advertising for their model
