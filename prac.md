# Intro



Sustainable management of any renewable resource requires understanding of system dynamics in response to exploitation. In a fisheries context the system is a semi-discrete self-sustaining population of fish called a *stock* (@begg1999stock), and the exploitation involves removing individuals by fishing.

- Management of multispecies fisheries is subject to many challenges.
    + Differing commercial importance and species productivities
    + Interactions between high and low productivity/importance stocks
    + SARA/COSEWIC species
    + Allocation of finite resources for effective management
    + Pacific Salmon
    + Allocation of management resources, eg. surveys, assessment
- Most management resources are directed towards the economic, or more important, species.
    + The resources that are left must be allocated amongst the remaining species.
- Allocation of resources in multispecies fisheries management is a difficult problem
    - governements and stakeholders try to balance intergenerational equity (biological risk) with employment security (social risk), though according to legislation (PA), biological risk must take precedence.
    - This either leads to effective hobbling of management, as already sparse resources must be spread across many species
    - This can lead to species missing out on resources all together, which means they may be falling into risky territory, and without adequate monitoring may do so undetected
- What constitutes "good enough" management of each species?
    + This will depend on
        * Commercial importance
        * Risk of overfishing
        * extent of species
        * etc.
    + What's the best allocation of resources to each species?


- In quota fisheries, when fish are caught together quota for weak/unabundant species constrains the utilisation of quota for others. I.E. Pinch Point Species
    + eg. Cultus lake sockeye 
    + eg. Yelloweye rockfish
