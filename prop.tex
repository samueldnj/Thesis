\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\subsection{Background}\label{background}

Sustainable management of any renewable resource requires understanding
the system dynamics in response to exploitation. In a multispecies
fisheries context the system is a collection of semi-discrete
self-sustaining fish populations or \emph{stocks} (Begg, Friedland, \&
Pearce (1999)), and the exploitation involves removing individuals by
fishing. Fishing effort impacts target species, non-target species and
fish habitat, and therefore a major challenge of multispecies fishery
management is to balance fishing yield with broader sustainability
goals.

Sustainable and scientifically defensible fishery management is built on
a foundation of fisheries stock assessment (Hilborn \& Walters (1992)).
Quantitative stock assessment methods combine elements of data science,
applied population ecology, risk assessment and resource management
(Figure 1). Analysts use data from multiple sources including scientific
surveys and commercial fishery monitoring to infer biological and
fishery dynamics and to characterise uncertainties and risks based on
these assessments. These inferences include estimates of species
abundance and productivity that are used to inform management decisions.

Stock assessments are lacking in most Canadian fisheries (Hutchings et
al. (2012)), especially for non-target species. One reason is that
non-target species are typically of lower commercial importance, so
there is limited interest in assessments. More commonly, data
limitations preclude the assessment of certain species, known as
data-limited species. Surveys designed for data-moderate target species
are often unsuitable for non-target species and leave managers with the
choice of conducting a flawed assessment, or no assessment at all.

A lack of assessments for some species within a multispecies fishery
threatens sustainable management of the whole fishery in two ways.
First, a lack of assessments creates conservation risks by weakening the
link between management decisions and stock status. The dynamic nature
of a fishery implies that the distribution of possible stock statuses
widens as time passes. Second, eco-certifiers typically require
up-to-date stock assessments for all species captured, regardless of
whether those stocks are targeted or not. A lack of eco-certification
reduces the capacity of a fishery for competition in international and
domestic markets, because buyers will prefer eco-certified products
(Pelc et al. (2015)).

\subsection{Technical Interactions in Multispecies
Fisheries}\label{technical-interactions-in-multispecies-fisheries}

Stock assessments are traditionally performed for a single species at a
time, even though this approach may lead to sub-optimal outcomes for
multispecies fisheries (Sugihara et al. (1984); Gulland \& Garcia
(1984)). Sub-optimal outcomes may arise from not accounting for the
effects of interactions between species. Interactions between fishes in
multispecies fisheries are one of two types: ecological or technical.
Ecological interactions are either non-trophic interactions, such as
competition over habitat or food, or trophic interactions between
predator and prey. Ecological interactions affect natural mortality of
fish and may bias estimates of species productivity (Mueter \& Megrey
(2006)). Technical interactions occur when multiple species are caught
in the same non-selective fishing gear, and are caused by multiple
species of fish being potentially available to the fishing gear.

Within the single-species paradigm, major stocks typically comprise
several distinct, but interacting, sub-stocks (Walters \& Martell
(2004); Ashleen J Benson, Cox, \& Cleary (2015)), such as Pacfic salmon
(\emph{Onchorynchys spp.}) (Simon \& Larkin (1972)). Multiple
ecologically and technically interacting populations (i.e., stocks) of
Chinook (\emph{O. tshawtcha}), Chum (\emph{O. keta}), Coho (\emph{O.
kisutch}), Pink (\emph{O. gorbausch}), Sockeye (\emph{O. nerka}) and
Steelhead (\emph{O. mykiss}) occur along Canada's Pacific coast. Each
species is made up of genetically distinct subpopulations, defined
mainly by discrete spawning habitats and run timing that establish
quasi-isolated reproductive populations (Ricker (1972)) connected by low
straying rates.

Managing hundreds of distinct fisheries is impractical (Walters \&
Martell (2004)) so salmon stocks are often grouped together into stock
complexes for management and assessment. For instance, in the Fraser
River, sub-populations of Chinook and Sockeye are grouped into aggregate
stock complexes called runs, which are based on similarity in life
history, geographical locations of spawning habitat and arrival timing
to fisheries (English, Edgell, Bocking, Link, \& Raborn (2011); DFO
(1999)). Managing Pacific salmon in runs has both advantages and
disadvantages. Advantages stem from more efficient management practices:
stocks in the same Sockeye run are fished based on an estimate of
sustainable yield for the whole run. While such aggregation might lead
to underexploitation of some stocks, there is a larger benefit from more
reliable and less costly assessments of the run due to data pooling. A
major disadvantage is overexploitation of the weakest stocks in the
complex if fishing pressure is calibrated to the average productivity of
the complex(Ricker (1958); Ricker (1973); Parkinson, Post, \& Cox
(2004)). Under this paradigm the weaker than average stocks will be
overfished (Figure 2) and eventually wiped out, creating a feedback
where average productivity of the complex increases, encouraging
overfishing of more stocks and fishing all but the most productive
stocks out of a complex. An example of this phenomenon occuring is the
Late run of Fraser river Sockeye salmon. The weakest stock in the Late
run is the Cultus lake stock, which had historic abundances of 700,000
spawners but in 2004 fewer than 100 spawners returned from the marine
life phase. The decline of Cultus lake Sockeye is caused in part by
harvesting at average productivity for the complex (Team (2009)). The
Late run is now harvested according to the productivity of the Cultus
lake stock in order to avoid this effect on the declining population.

The aggregate management approach used for Pacific salmon could be
extended to other multispecies fisheries. For example, groundfish
fisheries on the west coast of North America exploit stocks of
sablefish, Pacific halibut (\emph{Hippoglossus stenolopis}), several
species of rockfish (\emph{Sebastes spp.}), Pacific cod (\emph{Gadus
macrocephalus}), Dover sole (\emph{Microstomus pacificus}) and other
demersal species (Fisheries and Oceans, Canada (2015)). Different
groundfish genera and species have their own unique life histories and
reproductive strategies that respond differently to fishing pressure (S.
Jennings, Greenstreet, Reynolds, \& others (1999)). For instance,
flatfish are fast growing, mature early and have little parental
investment in their young, while rockfish are slow growing, mature later
and invest heavily in nursing (King \& McFarlane (2003)). Different life
histories and reproductive strategies among groundfish imply different
productivity levels, similar to mixed-stock Pacific salmon fisheries.

Differing productivity levels and technical interactions create
profitability constraints in multispecies fisheries managed through
quota systems (Hilborn, Punt, \& Orensanz (2004);Baudron \& Fernandes
(2015)). Constraints are caused by weaker low productivity species that
cannot be avoided when targeting stronger high productivity species.
Weaker species have low quota that is filled faster, so stronger species
are under-exploited in order to reduce the fishing pressure on the
weakest, or pinch-point, species (Figure 3) (Hilborn et al. (2004)). An
example of a pinch-point species is Boccacio rockfish (\emph{S.
paucispinis}) in the British Columbia groundfish fishery, which are
difficult to avoid when targeting lingcod (\emph{Ophiodon elongatus}).
Bocaccio rockfish are listed as Endangered by COSEWIC\footnote{Committee
  on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada.} and have a very low
annual quota of around 110 metric tonnes (mt), while lingcod are highly
productive with annual quota of around 3600mt. Avoidance of Bocaccio by
harvesters led to less than 33\% of Bocaccio quota to be utilised
between 2006 and 2014 (Figure 4). Technical interactions between
Bocaccio and lingcod means that this avoidance behaviour resulted in
around 25\% of lingcod quota being utilised in that same time period
(Figure 4). This underutilisation translates into a reduction of around
\textbf{DOLLAR AMOUNT}\footnote{February, 2016 prices \textbf{HEY DUMMY,
  ADJUST THIS FOR NPV}} gross revenue to the BCIGF between 2006 and
2014.

\subsection{Assess and Avoid}\label{assess-and-avoid}

Profitability constraints caused by technical interactions may be
alleviated by conducting stock assessments of data-limited species and
avoiding pinch-point species. Species that lack up-to-date assessments
often have their quota set to a low level for conservation reasons,
creating artificial pinch-points. After assessment the quota of a
data-limited species can be scaled to a better estimate of stock-status
(Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (1995)), which
could have 2 effects. Either the status is such that the pinch-point
created by the data-limitation can be removed, or the status requires
the pinch-point to remain. In the case where assessments show that the
pinch-point cannot be removed then an avoidance strategy is required.

One option for overcoming data limitations to assessments is by
explicitly acknowledging technical interactions in multispecies
fisheries (Mueter \& Megrey (2006); A. E. Punt, Smith, \& Smith (2011);
Zhou et al. (2010)). Technical interactions can be acknowledged by
aggregating multiple species into the same assessment complex or
assemblage based on co-occurence in fishing events, in a similar way to
Pacific salmon (Beverton et al. (1984); Walters \& Martell (2004)).
Statistical benefits of aggregation may allow previously unassessed
species to be assessed, and increase the profitability of the fishery by
relieving constraints and enabling eco-certification. While more
complicated than the single specie paradigm, the benefit of assessing
previously unassessed species may outweigh the costs.

\textbf{Based on a re-ordering of the diagram} Figure 6 shows three
possible models of fishery operation and management. Models (a) and (b)
are the current options for assessment in multispecies fisheries. Model
(a) is the status quo approach of single species stock assessment, where
every stock is treated as a separate population (Hilborn \& Walters
(1992)). Model (b) is the total aggregation approach used for Pacific
salmon (English et al. (2011)), where several species or stocks have
their data combined and are then assessed and managed as a single unit
(Sugihara et al. (1984); Gulland \& Garcia (1984); Gaichas et al.
(2012)).

The total aggregation approach used by Pacific salmon may not be
suitable for assessing assemblages of multiple species with distinct
life histories and reproductive strategies. Like in Pacfic salmon,
estimates of average productivity for an assemblage may be far from the
true value for each member stock, leading to over or under fishing of
some species. Model (c) in Figure 5 addresses this by keeping the data
separate as in model (a), but performs assessments for groups of stocks
using statistical models that link the data during estimation (Zhou et
al. (2010); A. E. Punt et al. (2011); Mueter \& Megrey (2006)).

In Chapters 1, 2 and 3 I conduct a simulation study of a hierarchical
stock assessment model to share data between species as in model(c) of
Figure 5 (Jiao, Hayes, \& Cortés (2009); Zhou et al. (2010); A. E. Punt
et al. (2011)). The statistical model assumes a hierarchical structure
of multispecies fisheries as shown in Figure 7, allowing for an an
intermediate level of aggregation between models (a) and (b) of Figure
6. Shared parameters in the hierarchical assessment model allow for some
of the benefits of aggregation for data-limited stocks, but the
separated data streams allows for species specific estimates of
abundance and productivity (Jiao et al. (2009)).

The focus of Chapter 1 is to create a simulation-estimation procedure to
study hierarchical assessment models for multi-species assemblages with
no sub-stock structure. Data generated by a process error population
dynamics model and observation model are provided to hierarchical
estimators (Zhou et al. (2010); A. E. Punt et al. (2011)). The
statistical performance of the estimators is then quantified by
comparing the true values of parameters to estimated values.

In Chapter 2, the simulation-estimation procedure is extended to
incorporate a sub-stock structure for each species. Including multiple
sub-stocks that correspond to possible multi-stock structure increases
the resolution of the data and allows for deviations from average life
history parameter values within each species (Su, Peterman, \& Haeseker
(2004)). Bias and precision are estimated and compared to the results of
Chapter 1, to analyse the benefits and costs of including increased
structure in the model.

In Chapter 3, the operating model and estimators are extended into a
closed loop feedback simulator (Figure 8). Closed loop simulation is the
tool at the core of management strategy evaluation (de la Mare (1998);
Sainsbury, Punt, \& Smith (2000)) and it allows assessment models to be
tested as part of a management procedure. Management procedures include
the assessment model, harvest strategies (Hilborn \& Walters (1992), Ch.
15) and decision rules for strategy implementation based on assessment
output. This involves creating an operating model that simulates
population dynamics of multiple interacting fish species, effort
dynamics of multiple fishing fleets with different gear types exploiting
those populations and uncertain observations made by scientific surveys
(Jones et al. (2009)). The multi-stock structure of Chapter 2 makes
realistic effort dynamics possible, such as targeting behaviour for
specific species based market forces (Hilborn \& Walters (1987);
Parkinson et al. (2004); Clark (2010)). Under the uncertainty provided
by the operating mode, all three components combine to produce complex
emergent properties of the management procedure, and closed loop
simulation offers a low-stakes option for analysing those properties and
the associated risks.

In Chapter 4, I investigate a new techology for avoiding non-target
species and estimate its economic value. Reliable and explicit
commercial data is becoming more abundant with increasing observer
coverage in modern fisheries. Concurrent with this, machine learning
methods are emerging that allow for analysis of data that isn't
collected under strict experimental designs (T. Hastie et al. (2009)),
like commercial fishing data. Chapter 4 is a feasibility study of using
machine learning methods to detect and avoid conditions leading to the
capture of non-target species. The economic value of avoiding non-target
species is estimated through analysing the value of information provided
by the machine learning approach.

\subsection{Study System}\label{study-system}

The British Columbia Integrated Groundfish Fishery (BCIGF) (Fisheries
and Oceans, Canada (2015)) is a group of 7 fisheries that spatially and
temporally overlap on the BC coast. The overlapping fisheries are
managed by one integrated individual transferrable quota system,
allowing temporary and permanent transfers of quota allocations between
licenses in different fleets. Quota is distributed to harvesters across
gear types and management areas for every species encountered, and
skippers that exceed their quota for a given species must obtain more
from quota holders or stop fishing for the season. All catch and
discards are deducted from quota allocations, and are therefore
monitored on 100\% of vessels by at sea observer or electronic
monitoring systems.

Integration and technical interactions react in problematic ways when
data limited non-target species interact with directed species. Data
limited species such as Petrale sole (\emph{Eopsetta jordani}) are not
able to be assessed, so stock status is unknown (Driscoll (2014)). If
assessments are lacking, quota is often set to a conservative level
based on the most recent stock assessment, if it exists. This creates an
artificial pinch-point species, that could be alleviated by assessing
and avoiding that species.

In Chapters 1, 2 and 3 the simulation study uses an assemblage composed
of all flatfish except halibut in the BCIGF as the biological component
of the operating model. This assemblage includes English sole
(\emph{Parophrys vetulus}), Dover sole (\emph{Microstomus pacificus}),
Petrale sole, Rock sole (\emph{Lepidopsetta bilineata}) and Arrowtooth
flounder (\emph{Atheresthes stomias}) (Fisheries and Oceans, Canada
(2015)). All fishes share evolutionary history as members of the family
\emph{Pleuronectidae} of right-eyed flounders, making this assemblage
suitable for a hierarchical approach due to similar but distinct life
histories. The amount of data available for different species varies,
with Rock sole being subject to regular assessments, and Petrale sole
having no up to date assessments (Driscoll (2014)). Halibut are excluded
from the assemblage as they are part of a separate, trans-boundary
directed fishery.

In Chapter 4, the feasibility study uses sub-legal sized sablefish as
its study system. Sablefish are at historic low abundances, with only
recent evidence of an increase in their abundance. Discard induced
mortality of sub-legal sablefish represents potential growth and
recruitment overfishing of the sablefish stock. Reducing discard induced
mortality may be an alternative to quota reduction for increasing
spawning stock biomass (\textbf{STOCK ASSESSMENT REFERENCE}). Discarding
of legal-sized sablefish (\textgreater{}55cm, good condition) is
economically disincentivised by a quota deduction adjusted for discard
induced mortality, but no such incentive or mortality rate exists for
unmarketable sablefish (\textless{}55cm, poor condition). This incentive
structure is evident in the distribution of sablefish discarding, with
\textbf{CONCRETE NUMBERS}\% of sablefish discards made up by sub-legal
sized fish.

\section{Chapter 1: Estimating Coastwide Abundance and Productivity in a
Multispecies Groundfish Fishery via a Hierarchical Stock Assessment
Model}\label{chapter-1-estimating-coastwide-abundance-and-productivity-in-a-multispecies-groundfish-fishery-via-a-hierarchical-stock-assessment-model}

\subsection{Background}\label{background-1}

Quantitative stock assessment models have 3 main components, outlined in
Table 2: the population dynamics model, the observational model and the
statistical model (Hilborn \& Walters (1992)). Model inputs are
candidate parameter values that are confronted by data in the
statistical model to produce posterior density or likelihood values as
outputs. Statistical model output is optimised or integrated over the
input parameters to extend inferences about stock productivity and
status in the form of distributional estimates.

Hierarchical statistical models are becoming increasingly popular for
analysing complex fisheries data. In Pacific salmon stock and
recruitment analyses, both Bayesian and frequentist (mixed effects)
hierarchical models are used in meta-analyses of multistock populations
(Su et al. (2004); Malick, Cox, Mueter, Peterman, \& Bradford (2015)).
More related to this thesis, stock assessment models that use
hierarchical statistical models are sometimes used to assess
multispecies complexes where data limitations are an issue for single
species management, such as technical interactions with data-limited
species (A. E. Punt et al. (2011)) or difficulties in species
identification (Jiao et al. (2009)).

In this chapter I use a simulation-estimation procedure to study
hierarchical Bayesian (Zhou et al. (2010)) and frequentist (A. E. Punt
et al. (2011)) state space surplus production models for assessment of a
multispecies flatfish assemblage with no sub-stock structure. These
models would be used to simultaneously assess target and non-target
species in Figure 1.3. In a comparison between single species and
hierarchical multispeceis models applied to real assemblages containing
data-limited species, it has been shown that the hierarchical models
qualitatively change parameter estimates for data-limited species (A. E.
Punt et al. (2011); Kell \& De Bruyn (2012)). However, it remains
unclear as to whether or not the change improves estimates of stock
status and productivity.

\textbf{QUESTION:} How do estimates of stock status and productivity for
data-limited species change when assessed using hierarchical
multispecies models?

Simulated fishery independent indices of abundance and fishery dependent
catch are used to test the effect of hierarchical assessment models on
estimates of parameters. True parameter values used for simulation can
be compared to estimated parameters in Monte-Carlo trials to understand
bias and precision of both estimators. Estimators are then tested across
a range of scenarios representing implications of technical interactions
between species, and contrasts in data availability.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}

This chapter uses the flatfish study assemblage defined in the
introduction. Each species in the flatfish assemblage is simulated
independently using the model defined in Table 2. Population dynamics
are simulated by a simple biomass dynamics process error-model (Figure
1.1, Eqs T2.2, T2.4), fishery dependent catch is generated by input
fishing mortality (Eq T2.3) and fishery independent observations of
catch per unit effort (CPUE) are generated by the observational model
(Figure 1.2, Eq T2.5).

Multispecies data produced by the simulation model are supplied to both
a Bayesian and frequentist version of a hierarchical state-space
assessment model (Figure 7). Both assessment models are specified in the
same way, shown in Table 3. The difference between the models is in how
the inferences are extended. For the Bayesian state space model the
posterior density (Eq. T3.8) is integrated over all input parameters
producing marginal distributions for each parameter (Gelman, Carlin,
Stern, \& Rubin (2014)). For the frequentist state space model, also
known as a random effects model, the posterior density is integrated
over the priors to produce a marginal ``true'' likelihood, which is then
maximised as in traditional likelihood methods (de Valpine \& Hastings
(2002)).

Both models require a numerical integration method to produce marginal
distributions or likelihoods (de Valpine \& Hastings (2002); Gelman et
al. (2014), Maunder, Deriso, \& Hanson (2015)). Integration generally
requires numerical methods like Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms for distribution sampling of complex non-linear, non-Gaussian
statistical models. To this end, the Bayesian model will be built using
the Automatic Differentiation Model Builder (ADMB) (Fournier et al.
(2012)) and the random effects model using Template Model Builder
(Kristensen, Nielsen, Berg, Skaug, \& Bell (2015)).

Model testing proceeds through Monte Carlo simulation trials of four
experimental scenarios, each representing either technical interactions
or data availability. Parameter estimates from each trial are then
compared to their true values generated by the simulator to estimate
bias and precision of the models in each scenario.

The first two parameters tested by experimental scenarios are process
error deviations \(\epsilon_{s,t}\) and species catchability
coefficients \(q_s\), representing effects of technical interactions
between species in the assemblage (A. E. Punt et al. (2011)). For
example, species that share the same habitat will encounter the same
environmental variation and this may introduce correlations in process
error deviations. Similarly, species that are in the same fishing
habitat may have similar interactions with fishing gear leading to
correlations in catchability.

Parameters representing the effects of technical interactions are
modeled hierarchically as shared parameters in the assessment model. For
example, equation T3.7 shows a shared prior on process error deviations.
In the first two experimental scenarios modifying correlations in shared
parameters, bias and precision are measured for different fixed values
of the prior variance (eg \(\sigma^2\)) in \((0,\infty)\) (Gelman et al.
(2014), Ch 5.5).

The remaining two parameters tested by experiments are contrasts in
observation error \(\delta_{s,t}\) and fishery development histories
\(F_t\), representing data or information available to fishery managers.
Observation error is a direct measurment of the quality of data obtained
by scientific surveys, so contrasts in observation error variance
\(\tau_s^2\) simulate differing levels of data availability between
species in an assemblage. Fishery development histories are also a
source of information, due to the way a fish population will respond to
differing levels of exploitation (ß@hilborn1992quantitative, Ch 2).

\subsection{Expected Results}\label{expected-results}

I expect this chapter to result in a working knowledge of how
hierarchical stock assessment models change the estimates of abundance
and productivity when applied to multispecies assemblages. Estimates of
model bias and precision as functions of correlation strengths,
observation error variance and historical fishing are produced. This
will result in a paper about the statistical properties of hierarchical
multispecies assessment models.

Assumptions about the strength of correlations in shared parameters are
likely to introduce bias through shrinkage towards a mean (Mueter,
Peterman, \& Pyper (2002)). The extent of the shrinkage introduced can
be understood by producing bias and precision estimates under a range of
fixed values of shared prior variance.

The extent to which limitations on data and species specific information
can be overcome (A. E. Punt et al. (2011)), if at all, can be quantified
through bias and precision estimates resulting from scenarios
contrasting data-availability and fishing histories. This is especially
helpful for fisheries in which there are limited historical fishing and
scientific data available, or limited resources for improving existing
scientific surveys.

\section{Chapter 2: Adding Multistock Structure to Multispecies
Hierarchical Stock Assessment
Models}\label{chapter-2-adding-multistock-structure-to-multispecies-hierarchical-stock-assessment-models}

\subsection{Background}\label{background-2}

A high degree of spatial variation in genetics, morphology, life-history
and behaviour is apparent in many exploited fish populations (Hilborn,
Quinn, Schindler, \& Rogers (2003); Schindler et al. (2010)). Management
of exploited fishes without acknowledgement of this variation risks
eroding biodiversity and increasing species vulnerability to
environmental variation (Hilborn et al. (2003); Cope \& Punt (2011)).

The approach most often used to manage species with high spatial
variation is to aggregate sub-stocks into a single management unit and
apply management procedures over large spatial scales (Cope \& Punt
(2011)). The assumption in the aggregation approach is that despite
spatial disaggregation of the stock, sub-stocks are connected by
migration creating a rescue effect (Dulvy, Sadovy, \& Reynolds (2003)).
Rescue effects are then believed to reduce the risks of managing
spatially complex species in a single aggregate (Cope \& Punt (2011)).

However, when stock structure is easily identified, as with Pacific
salmon, there are advantages to managing a species at the level of
individual stocks, called multistocks. For example, by estimating
productivity levels for 43 individual stocks of Pink salmon the effects
of local variation in sea surface temperature could be discovered (Su et
al. (2004)). Furthermore, estimating individual productivity levels
within a management complex reduces the risk of overfishing weak stocks
due to an averaging effect (Figure 2).

Managing multistocks also has its challenges. When the exact nature and
connectedness of the spatial stock structure is unknown, it is unclear
whether or not aggregation is the more precautionary management approach
(Ashleen Julia Benson (2011)). Furthermore, for a data-limited species
further disaggregation of the data will only raise further barriers to
stock assessment by reducing the amount of data available for each
sub-stock.

As in Chapter 1, a hierarchical stock assessment model may help overcome
data limitations when managing for multiple stocks in a multispecies
fishery (A. E. Punt et al. (2011)). Life histories within species are
likely to be more similar than between species, reducing variance in
prior distributions shared between stocks. Similarly, sub-stocks of
multiple species share habitat and experience shared environmental
variation allowing for the definition of sub-assemblages with shared
priors on process error (Kallianiotis, Vidoris, \& Sylaios (2004)).

\textbf{QUESTION:} How do estimates of abundance and productivity change
when including sub-stock structure assessments of data-limited species
in a hierarchical assessment model?

The BCIGF non-halibut flatfish assemblage exhibits evidence of sub-stock
structure. For example, there is evidence that the species population of
English sole on the British Columbia coast is made up of multiple
segregated major stocks with limited migration (Hart, Clemens, \& others
(1973)). The simulation experiments of Chapter 1 will be repeated after
the addition of stock structure to the assemblage, to investigate the
effects of the hierarchical estimators under data limitations.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods-1}

The methods for this chapter require small structural changes to the
simulation and estimation procedures from Chapter 1 in order to increase
data resolution. The simulation model now simulates individual stocks
\(j\) of each species \(s\) (Table 5). Migration can now occur between
stocks within each species, making stock dynamics interdependent (T5.4).

The estimation procedure includes another layer of hierarchical
structure to include multiple substocks (Figure 8). The multiple stocks
within a species now share parameters through prior distributions at the
species level. The hyperparameters of shared priors at the species level
then share hyperpriors with other species at the assemblage level.

Six experimental scenarios evaluated by estimating bias and precision
extend the four outlined in Chapter 1. The original four will be
extended to account for the increased depth in the assemblage structure.
The first additional scenario models increased data-limitation
introduced by disaggregating an already data-limited species into
multiple stocks. Disaggregation could lead to increased observation
error variance or entirely missing observations for some stocks. The
final additional experiment introduces spatial covariation in the state
dynamics simulation for each stock (\textbf{FIGREF??}) and tests the
benefit of including spatial variation in the estimator.

\subsection{Expected Results}\label{expected-results-1}

I expect this chapter to deepen understanding of hierarchical estimators
and their application in a multistock context. Adding stock structure
involves increased model complexity and reduced data availability due to
disaggregation, introducing a tradeoff. This tradeoff is then evaluated
by varying data availability and model complexity and examining how
model bias and precision change. A publication detailing the tradeoffs
between bias and precision under different model structures is expected
to result from this analysis.

\section{Chapter 3: Performance of a Management Procedure Using an
Hierarchical Stock Assessment Model for a Multispecies Groundfish
Fishery}\label{chapter-3-performance-of-a-management-procedure-using-an-hierarchical-stock-assessment-model-for-a-multispecies-groundfish-fishery}

\subsection{Background}\label{background-3}

The fisheries management procedure extends beyond the stock assessment
model (Figure 1). Stock assessment output (Figure 1.3) informs a
decision rule (Figure 1.4) that determines the amount of fishing effort
expended to collect the harvest quota (Figure 1.5). This effort
dynamically impacts fish populations and their habitat (Figure 1.1),
providing new data (Figure 1.2) that is used for assessment.

An important test for an assessment model is how it performs as part of
a management procedure. Management procedures include harvest
strategies, which are input or output controls on the fishery (Hilborn
\& Walters (1992), Ch. 15) and decision rules that scale controls to
stock status. Management procedures made up of decision rules, harvest
strategies and assessment models represent the full management cycle of
a fishery.

In this chapter, I use closed loop simulation to test management
procedures based on a hierarchical multispecies stock assessment model.
Closed loop simulation modeling explicitly quantifies feedback in a
dynamic system (de la Mare (1998); Sainsbury et al. (2000)). In a
fisheries management context, the closed loop includes the management
procedure, fish stocks and commercial and scientific data in a feedback
loop (Figure 9). The fishery, population dynamics and scientific survey
are part an operating model (Jones et al. (2009)) that provide data to
the assessment model and harvest control rule as part of a management
procedure. Management procedure evaluation then proceeds by
experimentally adjusting model parameters and observing the emergent
behaviour. In this way, potential risks of management can be quantified
under a given set of assumptions.

Simulating a multistock, multispecies fishery requires a more
sophisticated simulator than in Chapters 1 and 2. For example,
harvesters expend fishing effort based on expected costs and benefits of
fishing, including expected catch composition and personal risk.

\textbf{QUESTION:} How can realistic targeting behaviour be included in
the operating model?

Targeting behaviour comes down to when and where harvesters expend their
effort. That is, targeting behaviour can be simulated by including
fishing effort dynamics for multiple fishing fleets (gear types) in the
operating model (Hilborn \& Walters (1987)). These dynamics are based on
estimates of fishery dependent catchability \(q_{f,s,t}\) (Table 7) can
be empirically drawn from commercial data or simulated parametrically.

Once realistic effort dynamics are included in the operating model,
inherent risks of assessment model assumptions can be assessed across
multiple experimental scenarios. Experiments include contrast in
data-quality, taking into account spatial covariation due to
environmental forcing (Dichmont, Deng, Punt, Venables, \& Haddon (2006))
.

\textbf{QUESTION:} How do multispecies hierarchical assessment models
perform when managing multispecies assemblages containing data limited
stocks, with performance measured by probability of overfishing,
underfishing and variation in annual catch?

I answer this question by running experimental scenarios that measure
the relationship between management risks and data quality. For example,
risk countour plots (\textbf{FIGURE}) could help inform policy for the
application of hierarchical assessment models or communication with
stakeholders when providing harvest advice.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods-2}

The closed loop simulation extends the simulation model of Chapter 2
into an operating model including effort dynamics (Tables 7, 8 \textbf{8
not done yet}). At each time step \(t\), the current state of each fish
population is estimated by the assessment model. Asessment models then
forecast abundance at time \(t+1\), which is passed through a harvest
control rule (HCR) to generate a total allowable catch (TAC) or each
species. The TAC for each species is then supplied to the operating
model, which distributes fishing effort (Hilborn \& Walters (1987))
across space in order to maximise some objective, such as fishing
profit, subject to the constraints of the TAC.

Fishing effort dynamics are simulated by through a 2 stage procedure at
each time step (Hilborn \& Walters (1987)). First, some test fishing is
conducted by expending a unit of effort in each fleet and fishing
location (statistical area). Then, based on fleet objectives and
observed fishery dependent catch rates, the operating model will
distribute effort to maximise the objective subject to the TAC for every
species. It is possible that these dynamics will lead to underutilised
quota for some species, effectively simulating pinch-points.

Management procedures featuring assessment models from Chapters 1 and 2
areused in experimental scenarios. Experiments test a range of
observation error variances, process error variances, fishery
development history and correlations in catchability \(q_{s,j,t}\). Each
simulation measures quota utilisation, species depletion, probability of
exceeding optimal instantaneous fishing mortality and annual average
variation. Simulation output is then used to compare between scenarios
and management procedures, quantifying performance and risks of each
procedure.

\subsection{Expected Results}\label{expected-results-2}

For each experiment a plot of overfishing risk as a function of contrast
like Figure (\textbf{FIGURE}) will be produced. This plot will show
contours of probability that the actual fishing mortality rate \(F_t\)
is greater than the fishing mortality rate giving MSY \(F_{MSY}\). The
\(y\)-axis will show target fishing mortality \(F_t\) or effort \(E_t\),
and the \(x\)-axis will show the parameter driving the contrast.

\section{Chapter 4: Avoiding non-target
species.}\label{chapter-4-avoiding-non-target-species.}

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}

Quota on directed species in the BCIGF is constrained by restrictive
quotas on pinch-point species and size limits on directed species, both
of which are caught as bycatch. For example, an average of 160 tonnes
per year of Sablefish below 55cm in length were discarded by trap and
trawl fishing vessels between 2007 and 2015 in the BCIGF \textbf{SOURCE:
GFFOS}. Those discards are due to a size regulation intended to reduce
catch of juvenile fish, and so the mortality induced represents growth
and recruitment overfishing of Sablefish. This is made particularly
challenging by the migratory behaviour of juvenile Sablefish
\textbf{(FIGURE)}.

  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

A quantitative model-based approach to forecasting bycatch could be
combined with a fleet communication approach as a form of small-scale
dynamic ocean management (Vilela \& Bellido (2015); Sims, Cox, \&
Lewison (2008); Dunn, Maxwell, Boustany, \& Halpin (2016)). Most
approaches to dynamic management and fleet communication in other
fisheries are based on ad-hoc data-based methods, possibly due to
reluctance of harvesters to communicate and issues with data quality
(Gilman, Dalzell, \& Martin (2006)). The unique, reliable GFFOS data set
and the infrastructure used to create it could provide an easy route to
the implementation of small scale management processes.

In this chapter I test the feasibility of a model-based approach to
forecasting bycatch of juvenile Sablefish using commercial data from BC
fisheries. Due to the non-random nature of fishing efforts traditional
statistical methods that rely on the central limit theorem are
unsuitable. Instead, machine learning methods, known as \emph{learners},
will be used to sidestep statistical assumptions and search for
correlations in the data (C. M. Bishop (2006); T. Hastie et al. (2009)).

Several learners will be developed and tested individually and as part
of a combined model called an \emph{ensemble} learner. Initially,
learners will be calibrated for forecasting presence or absence of
juvenile Sablefish. This will involve testing a range of possible
environmental, temporal and spatial variables for their predictive
importance.

\textbf{QUESTION:} What are the important predictors for the presence of
juvenile Sablefish in commercial catch in the trawl and trap sectors?

Learners that predict categorical variables such as presence and absence
are known as \emph{classifiers}. Possible predictor variables include
spatial and temporal variables from the GFFOS database and environmental
and oceanographic variables taken from external sources. Importance can
be measured through several means, all of which involve some measure of
classifier performance when the predictor is included or excluded.

Classifiers often return a probabilistic output similar to a logistic
regression. To turn this probabilistic output into a categorical
prediction a classification probability threshold is required. Typically
a threshold of \(0.5\) is used as an objective default, but this is an
arbitrary choice. Threshold probabilities can be tuned to optimise
different performance criteria, and the sensitivity of the threshold to
the criteria is an important feature of a classifier model (Freeman \&
Moisen (2008)).

\textbf{QUESTION:} What is the sensitivity of classification threshold
to performance criteria?

High sensitivity of a classification threshold to the choice of
performance criteria can indicate low discriminatory power of a learner
(Freeman \& Moisen (2008)). Testing thresholds and criteria will allow
for calibration of the model, and help determine if a model is suitable
for forecasting.

Given a feasible model with high discriminatory ability, I next want to
test its ability to predict the biomass of juvenile Sablefish caught.
This prediction could be important from a dynamic ocean management
perspective, where small scale closures can be enacted based on the
predicted value. It could also be directly valuable to harvesters from a
cost-benefit perspective, where the expected cost of a small amount of
non-target species at low probability is worth the expected benefit of a
large amount of target species.

\textbf{QUESTION:} What are the important predictors for (a) fishery
dependent CPUE and (b) biomass of juvenile Sablefish in commercial catch
in BC trawl and trap fisheries?

Again, possible predictor variables include spatial and temporal
variables from the GFFOS database and environmental and oceanographic
variables taken from external sources. Prediction may be performed
either by regression or classification into ordinal categories, and this
will dictate how learner peformance and predictor performance are
quantified.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods-3}

Predictive capacity of machine learning for detecting juvenile Sablefish
will be tested across several learner algorithms and multiple ensemble
structures. Ensembles are used to avoid overfitting by single learners
through model averaging of different forms (Rokach (2010)). Some
learners, such as the Random Forest algorithm (Breiman (2001)) are made
up of many models and are themselves ensembles.

Learners will be tested first by their capacity to predict presence or
absence of juvenile Sablefish in data taken from the GFFOS. Three sets
of data will be used: commerical trawl data, commercial trap data, and
both sectors combined. Each data set will will go through the same
process of model selection and calibration at two levels: the individual
learners and the ensemble structures. At all stages, Monte-Carlo trials
of cross-validation will be used to produce distributions of model
performance.

Model selection for the learners will be performed by testing the
importance of various predictor variables. I'll test two ways to assess
predictor importance. First, through a sensitivity analysis that
measures decreases in accuracy from random perturbations of predictor
variable values, as is performed by the Random Forest (Breiman (2001)).
Second, through the effect of variable selection on performance of the
model.

Performance of individual learners will be calibrated by optimising
their classification thresholds to different criteria including
\(\kappa\), percentage correctly classified, and true negative and true
positive rates (Freeman \& Moisen (2008)). True positive and true
negative rates could have asymmetric costs if a predictor like this is
used in management decisions, so asymmetric loss functions will be
tested.

Model selection at the ensemble level requires selection of the
individual learners, and a method to combine them. Individual learners
will be selected based on the sensitivity of thresholds to performance
criteria, which is a proxy for discrimanatory power (Freeman \& Moisen
(2008)). Learners with low discriminatory power may be unsuitable to
prediction of bycatch when expanded to true forecasts in practice, and
will therefore be excluded from ensembles.Ensemble structures range from
simple weighted model averaging to more complicated Bayesian Model
Combination technique (Monteith, Carroll, Seppi, \& Martinez (2011)).
Ensemble calibration will depend on the choice of ensemble structure.

Finally, I'll attempt to predict the amount of juvenile Sablefish caught
if classification of presence and absence is feasible. Both absolute
catch and fishery-dependent catch per unit effort will be used as
possible response variables. Prediction of both responses could be done
through regression or an extension of the classification method to
multiple ordinal classes. For regression, new calibration and model
selection techniques are possible, such as the lasso method for variable
selection (Tibshirani (1996)). Regression and classification could also
be combined in a ``hurdle'' model. Hurdle models predict an amount by
regression only if a presence is predicted by the classifier, and are
often used in zero-inflated data sets such as commercial bycatch data
(Sims et al. (2008)).

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

This thesis will undertake a study of stock assessment methods for
assemblages of multiple interacting species. The focus is on the Robin
Hood (RH) method, which contains a hierarchical statistical model
linking the data of multiple species. The RH method could prove valuable
for data-variable fisheries that are unable to produce stock assessments
for all species that they contain. Those species that were previously
unable to be assessed could potentially fall inside the stable risk
region of the RH method allowing scientifically defensible TACs to be
set. This would help some fisheries obtain eco-certification (MSC,
Seafood Watch, seaChoice), helping to improve biological sustainability
of market share.

Further to contributions to the field of fisheries science, this thesis
also satisfies the interdisciplinary spirit of REM in two chapters.
First, assessing multiple species simultaneously using the RH approach
brings possible advantages, such as an efficient allocation of survey
resources. Such advantages are to be tested in Chapter 2 through
management strategy evaluation, synthesising ecological drivers of
population dynamics and economic drivers of fishing effort. The other
methods - single species (SS) and total aggregation (TA) - are analysed
as alternatives to the RH method in a risk assessment in Chapter 3. The
risk assessment is intended to recommend data-requirements and harvest
control rules for stable social and biological risk, synthesising
economics, ecology and policy.

\subsection{Resource allocation improvement (taken from
intro)}\label{resource-allocation-improvement-taken-from-intro}

Efficient allocation of resources is therefore an important part of the
sustainable management of multispecies fisheries. This para needs refs,
better ideas and structure. Does it even go here? Maybe combine it with
the following paragraph on multispecies assessments. Also, include
information here about ``good enough'' mechanisms for resource
distribution • SARA, PA state that at a given level of biological risk,
a recovery process has to be implemented. • Are expensive, model based
assessments required for every species? • What constitutes ``good
enough'' management? • There are two parts to resource allocation 1.
Identification of need - pinch-point species are an externality on
directed species 2. Mechanisms for resource distribution - good enough
MPs: Swept-area, total Agg, RH\ldots{} • A paralysis of choice is common
in situations like this.

I propose a practical, stake-holder driven management approach that
seeks to to satisfy conservation concerns while increasing economic
welfare in multispecies fisheries. Assessment techniques should be
\emph{practical} in that they achieve conservation and management goals
efficiently, such as reserving the most technologically advanced and
resource intensive management procedures for those stocks that
absolutely need it. Management decisions should be \emph{stake-holder
driven}, where priority is given to actions that increase the economic
welfare of the fishery. This will allow for positive economic feedback
and increase the pool of resources available for future management of
the fishery. The goal of a practical, stake-holder driven management
approach is to simultaneously improve the sustainability
(intergenerational equity) and profitability of multispecies fisheries.
