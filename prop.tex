\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\subsection{Background}\label{background}

Sustainable management of any renewable resource requires understanding
the system dynamics in response to exploitation. In a multispecies
fisheries context, the system is a collection of semi-discrete
self-sustaining fish populations or \emph{stocks} (Begg, Friedland, \&
Pearce (1999)) and the exploitation involves removing individuals by
fishing. Fishing effort impacts target species, non-target species and
fish habitat, and therefore a major challenge of multispecies fishery
management is to balance fishing yield with broader sustainability
goals.

Sustainable and scientifically defensible fishery management is built on
a foundation of fisheries stock assessment (Hilborn \& Walters (1992)).
Quantitative stock assessment methods combine elements of data science,
applied population ecology, risk assessment and resource management
(Figure 1). Analysts use data from multiple sources including scientific
surveys and commercial fishery monitoring to infer biological and
fishery dynamics and to characterise uncertainties and risks based on
these assessments. These inferences include estimates of species
abundance and productivity that are used to inform management decisions.

Stock assessments are lacking in most Canadian fisheries (Hutchings et
al. (2012)), especially for non-target species. One reason is that
non-target species are typically of lower commercial importance, so
there is limited interest in assessments. More commonly, data
limitations preclude the assessment of certain species, known as
data-limited species. Surveys designed for data-moderate target species
are often unsuitable for non-target species and leave managers with the
choice of conducting a flawed assessment, or no assessment at all.

A lack of assessments for some species within a multispecies fishery
threatens sustainable management of the whole fishery in two ways.
First, a lack of assessments creates conservation risks by weakening the
link between management decisions and stock status. The dynamic nature
of a fishery implies that the distribution of possible stock statuses
widens as time passes. Second, eco-certifiers typically require
up-to-date stock assessments for all species captured, regardless of
whether those stocks are targeted or not. A lack of eco-certification
reduces the capacity of a fishery for competition in international and
domestic markets, because buyers will prefer eco-certified products
(Pelc et al. (2015)).

\subsection{Assessments Acknowledging Technical
Interactions}\label{assessments-acknowledging-technical-interactions}

Stock assessments are traditionally performed for a single species at a
time, even though this approach may lead to sub-optimal outcomes for
multispecies fisheries (Sugihara et al. (1984); Gulland \& Garcia
(1984)). Sub-optimal outcomes may arise from not accounting for the
effects of interactions between species. Interactions between fishes in
multispecies fisheries are one of two types: ecological or technical.
Ecological interactions are either non-trophic, such as competition, or
trophic, between predator and prey. Ecological interactions affect
natural mortality of fish and may bias estimates of species productivity
when not taken into account (Mueter \& Megrey (2006)). Technical
interactions occur when multiple species are caught in the same
non-selective fishing gear, and are caused by multiple species of fish
being potentially available to the fishing gear.

Within the single-species paradigm, major stocks typically comprise
several distinct, but interacting, sub-stocks (Walters \& Martell
(2004); Benson, Cox, \& Cleary (2015)), such as Pacfic salmon
(\emph{Onchorynchys spp.}) (Simon \& Larkin (1972)). Multiple
ecologically and technically interacting populations (i.e., stocks) of
Chinook (\emph{O. tshawtcha}), Chum (\emph{O. keta}), Coho (\emph{O.
kisutch}), Pink (\emph{O. gorbausch}), Sockeye (\emph{O. nerka}) and
Steelhead (\emph{O. mykiss}) occur along Canada's Pacific coast. Each
species is made up of genetically distinct subpopulations, defined
mainly by discrete spawning habitats and run timing that establish
quasi-isolated reproductive populations (Ricker (1972)) connected by low
straying rates.

Managing hundreds of distinct fisheries is impractical (Walters \&
Martell (2004)) so salmon stocks are often grouped together into stock
complexes for management and assessment. For instance, in the Fraser
River, sub-populations of Chinook and Sockeye are grouped into aggregate
stock complexes called runs based on similarity in life history,
geographical locations of spawning habitat and arrival timing to
fisheries (English, Edgell, Bocking, Link, \& Raborn (2011); DFO
(1999)). Managing Pacific salmon in runs has both advantages and
disadvantages. Aggregation leads to increased management efficiency and
brings adds statistical benefits from data pooling. However, to avoid
overfishing some stocks (Figure 2), complexes must be managed according
to the weakest stock's productivity (Ricker (1958); Ricker (1973);
Parkinson, Post, \& Cox (2004)). The Late run of Fraser river Sockeye is
managed for the weakest stock: Cultus lake. The Cultus lake stock has
historic abundances of up to 700,000 spawners, but in 2004 fewer than
100 spawners returned from the marine life phase. The decline of Cultus
lake Sockeye is caused in part by harvesting at average productivity for
the complex (Team (2009)). The Late run is now harvested according to
the productivity of the Cultus lake stock in order to avoid this effect
on the declining population.

The aggregate management schema used for Pacific salmon could be
modified and adopted in other multispecies fisheries. For example,
groundfish fisheries on the west coast of North America exploit stocks
of sablefish, Pacific halibut (\emph{Hippoglossus stenolopis}), several
species of rockfish (\emph{Sebastes spp.}), Pacific cod (\emph{Gadus
macrocephalus}), Dover sole (\emph{Microstomus pacificus}) and other
demersal species (Fisheries and Oceans, Canada (2015)). Different
groundfish genera and species have their own unique life histories and
reproductive strategies that respond differently to fishing pressure (S.
Jennings, Greenstreet, Reynolds, \& others (1999)). Different life
histories and reproductive strategies among groundfish imply different
productivity levels, similar to mixed-stock Pacific salmon fisheries.

Multiple interacting species with different productivity levels create
profitability constraints in multispecies fisheries managed through
quota systems (Hilborn, Punt, \& Orensanz (2004);Baudron \& Fernandes
(2015)). Constraints are caused by weaker, low productivity species that
cannot be avoided when targeting stronger, high productivity species.
Weaker species' quota is filled faster, so stronger species are
under-exploited in order to reduce the fishing pressure on the weakest,
or pinch-point, species (Figure 3) (Hilborn et al. (2004)). An example
of a pinch-point species is Boccacio rockfish (\emph{S. paucispinis}) in
the British Columbia groundfish fishery, which are difficult to avoid
when targeting lingcod (\emph{Ophiodon elongatus}). Bocaccio rockfish
are listed as Endangered by COSEWIC\footnote{Committee on the Status of
  Endangered Wildlife in Canada.} and have a very low annual quota of
around 110 metric tonnes (mt), while lingcod are highly productive with
annual quota of around 3600mt. Avoidance of Bocaccio by harvesters led
to less than 33\% of Bocaccio quota to be utilised between 2006 and 2014
(Figure 4). Technical interactions between Bocaccio and lingcod means
that this avoidance behaviour resulted in a maximum of 25\% of lingcod
quota being utilised in that same time period (Figure 5). This
underutilisation translates into a reduction of around \textbf{DOLLAR
AMOUNT}\footnote{February, 2016 prices \textbf{HEY DUMMY, ADJUST THIS
  FOR NPV}} gross revenue to the BCIGF between 2006 and 2014.

\subsection{Assess and Avoid}\label{assess-and-avoid}

Profitability constraints caused by technical interactions may be
alleviated by conducting stock assessments of data-limited species and
avoiding pinch-point species. Species that lack up-to-date assessments
often have their quota set to a low level for conservation reasons,
creating artificial pinch-points. After assessment the quota of a
data-limited species can be scaled to a better estimate of stock-status
(Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (1995)), which
could have 2 effects. Either the status is such that the pinch-point
created by the data-limitation can be removed, or the status requires
the pinch-point to remain. In the case where assessments show that the
pinch-point cannot be removed then an avoidance strategy is required.

One option for overcoming data limitations to assessments is by
explicitly acknowledging technical interactions in assessment models
(Mueter \& Megrey (2006); A. E. Punt, Smith, \& Smith (2011); Zhou et
al. (2010)). Technical interactions can be acknowledged by aggregating
multiple species into the same assessment complex or assemblage based on
co-occurence in fishing events, similar to Pacific salmon runs (Beverton
et al. (1984); Walters \& Martell (2004)). Statistical benefits of
aggregation may allow previously unassessed species to be assessed, and
increase the profitability of the fishery by relieving constraints and
enabling eco-certification. While more complicated than the single
specie paradigm, the benefit of assessing previously unassessed species
may outweigh the costs.

Figure 6 shows three possible models of fishery operation and
management. Models (a) and (b) are the current options for assessment in
multispecies fisheries. Model (a) is the status quo approach of single
species stock assessment, where every stock is treated as a separate
population (Hilborn \& Walters (1992)). Model (b) is the total
aggregation approach used for Pacific salmon (English et al. (2011)),
where several species or stocks have their data combined and are then
assessed and managed as a single unit (Sugihara et al. (1984); Gulland
\& Garcia (1984); Gaichas et al. (2012)).

The total aggregation approach used by Pacific salmon may not be
suitable for assessing assemblages of multiple species with distinct
life histories and reproductive strategies. Model (c) in Figure 5
addresses this by keeping the data separate as in model (a), but
performs assessments for groups of stocks using statistical models that
link the data during estimation (Zhou et al. (2010); A. E. Punt et al.
(2011); Mueter \& Megrey (2006)).

In Chapters 1, 2 and 3 I conduct a simulation study of a hierarchical
stock assessment model to share data between species as in model (c) of
Figure 6 (Jiao, Hayes, \& Cortés (2009); Zhou et al. (2010); A. E. Punt
et al. (2011)). The statistical model assumes a hierarchical structure
of multispecies fisheries as shown in Figure 7, allowing for an an
intermediate level of aggregation between models (a) and (b) of Figure
6. Shared parameters in the hierarchical assessment model provide some
of the benefits of aggregation, but the separation of data streams
allows for species specific estimates of abundance and productivity
(Jiao et al. (2009)).

The focus of Chapter 1 is to create a simulation-estimation procedure to
study hierarchical assessment models for multi-species assemblages with
no sub-stock structure. Data generated by a process error population
dynamics model and observation model are provided to hierarchical
estimators (Zhou et al. (2010); A. E. Punt et al. (2011)). The
statistical performance of the estimators is then quantified by
comparing the true values of parameters to estimated values.

In Chapter 2, the simulation-estimation procedure incorporates a spatial
sub-stock structure for each species (Figure 9). Including multiple
sub-stocks increases the resolution of the data and allows for multiple
stock specific life history parameter values within each species (Su,
Peterman, \& Haeseker (2004)). Bias and precision are estimated and
compared to coastwide model bias and precision, to analyse the benefits
and costs of including increased structure in the model.

In Chapter 3, a closed loop feedback simulator is used to evaluate
management procedures using spatially structured multistock and
multispecies hierarchical models (Figure 10). This involves creating an
operating model that simulates population dynamics of multiple
interacting fish species, effort dynamics of multiple fishing fleets
with different gear types exploiting those populations and uncertain
observations made by scientific surveys (Hilborn \& Walters (1987);
Walters \& Bonfil (1999); M. L. Jones et al. (2009); Clark (2010)).
Uncertain data provided by the operating model react with the management
procedure to produce complex emergent properties. Closed loop simulation
offers a low-stakes option for analysing those properties and the
associated risks.

In Chapter 4, I investigate a data-based approach to avoiding non-target
species and estimate its economic value. Reliable, spatially explicit
commercial data is becoming more abundant with increasing observer
coverage in modern fisheries. Concurrent with this, machine learning
methods are emerging that allow for analysis of data that isn't
collected under strict experimental designs (T. Hastie et al. (2009)),
such as commercial fishing data.

\subsection{Study System}\label{study-system}

The British Columbia Integrated Groundfish Fishery (BCIGF) (Fisheries
and Oceans, Canada (2015)) is a group of 7 fisheries that spatially and
temporally overlap on the BC coast. The overlapping fisheries are
managed across 8 statistical areas (Figure 11) by one integrated
individual transferrable quota system, allowing temporary and permanent
transfers of quota allocations between licenses in different fleets. All
catch and discards are deducted from quota allocations, and are
therefore monitored on 100\% of vessels by at sea observer or electronic
monitoring systems. Skippers who exceed their quota share must either
obtain more from other harvesters, or stop fishing for the season.

Integrated management of the BCIGF creates pinch-points on quota
utilisation, caused by technical interactions between directed species
and data limited non-target species. Many species lack up-to-date
assessments (Driscoll (2014)) creating artificial pinch-points that
could be alleviated by assessing and avoiding those species.

In Chapters 1, 2 and 3 the simulation study uses a multispecies complex
composed of all flatfish except halibut in the BCIGF as the biological
component of the operating model. The complex is made up of
\textbf{D}over sole (\emph{Microstomus pacificus}), \textbf{E}nglish
sole (\emph{Parophrys vetulus}), \textbf{R}ock sole (\emph{Lepidopsetta
bilineata}), \textbf{P}etrale sole and \textbf{A}rrowtooth flounder
(\emph{Atheresthes stomias}) (Fisheries and Oceans, Canada (2015)), and
called the \textbf{DERPA} complex for brevity. All members of DERPA are
from the family \emph{Pleuronectidae} of right-eyed flounders, making
DERPA suitable for a hierarchical approach due to similar but distinct
life and evolutionary histories. Furthermore, Dover sole, Petrale sole
and Arrowtooth flounder experience technical interactions in trawl gear
that encounters Sablefish (Figure 12). Halibut are excluded as they are
managed by a separate trans-boundary authority.

The amount of data available for DERPA flatfish species varies, and so
does the timing of stock status assessments. Rock sole was assessed in
2016 (K. R. Holt, Starr, Haigh, \& Krishka (2016)) and 2014 (DFO
(2014)), and Arrowtooth flounder in 2015 (DFO (2015)), but before that
both species were not assessed for close to a decade\footnote{Rock sole
  were assessed in 2005 in an unpublished working paper, see K. R. Holt
  et al. (2016).} (Jeff Fargo, Kronlund, Schnute, \& Haigh (2000); Jeff
Fargo \& Starr (2001)). English and Petrale sole were last assessed in
2009 (Starr (2009); Starr (070AD)). Dover sole was last assessed in 1999
and has never been assessed using a model based assessment (J. Fargo
(1999)). \textbf{\emph{MAKE THIS PARAGRAPH A FIGURE}}

In Chapter 4, I use machine learning methods to forecast the presence of
sub-legal sized sablefish in fishing events. Sablefish are at historic
low abundances and are subject to a rebuilding strategy (\textbf{REFS}).
Reducing discard induced mortality of juvenile sablefish may be an
alternative to quota reduction for increasing spawning stock biomass
(\textbf{STOCK ASSESSMENT REFERENCE}). Discarding of legal-sized
sablefish (\textgreater{}55cm, good condition) is economically
disincentivised by a quota deduction adjusted for discard induced
mortality, but no such incentive or mortality rate exists for
unmarketable sablefish (\textless{}55cm, poor condition). This incentive
structure is evident in the distribution of sablefish discarding, with
\textbf{CONCRETE NUMBERS}\% of sablefish discards made up by sub-legal
sized fish.

\section{Chapter 1: Estimating Coastwide Abundance and Productivity in a
Multispecies Groundfish Fishery via a Hierarchical Stock Assessment
Model}\label{chapter-1-estimating-coastwide-abundance-and-productivity-in-a-multispecies-groundfish-fishery-via-a-hierarchical-stock-assessment-model}

\subsection{Background}\label{background-1}

Quantitative stock assessment models incorporate population dynamics
processes (Figure 1.1), observational data (Figure 1.2) and a
statistical model (Figure 1.3) (Hilborn \& Walters (1992)). Model inputs
are candidate parameter values that are confronted by data in the
statistical model to produce posterior density or likelihood function
values as outputs. Statistical model output is then optimised or
integrated over the input parameters to extend inferences about stock
productivity and status in the form of distributional estimates.

Hierarchical statistical models are becoming increasingly popular for
analysing complex fisheries data. In Pacific salmon stock and
recruitment analyses, both Bayesian and frequentist (mixed effects)
hierarchical models are used in meta-analyses of multistock populations
(Su et al. (2004); Malick, Cox, Mueter, Peterman, \& Bradford (2015)).
More related to this thesis, stock assessment models that use
hierarchical statistical models are sometimes used to assess
multispecies complexes where data limitations are an issue for single
species management, such as technical interactions between data-limited
species (A. E. Punt et al. (2011)) or difficulties in species
identification (Jiao et al. (2009)).

In this chapter, I use a simulation-estimation procedure to study
hierarchical Bayesian (Zhou et al. (2010)) and frequentist (A. E. Punt
et al. (2011)) state space multispecies assessment models. The
multispecies models are used to simultaneously assess a simulated
version of the DERPA complex of flatfish. In a comparison between single
species and hierarchical models applied multispecies groups including
data-limited species, it has been shown that the hierarchical models
induce a change in parameter estimates for data-limited species (A. E.
Punt et al. (2011); Kell \& De Bruyn (2012)). However, it is unknown if
that change is an increase or decrease in bias.

\textbf{QUESTION:} How do estimates of unfished biomass \(B_0\), growth
\(r\) and catchability \(q\) made by hierarchical multispecies models
compare to estimates from single species models?

Simulated scientific and commercial data are used to test hierarchical
assessment models. True parameter values used for simulation can be
compared to estimated parameters in Monte-Carlo trials to understand
bias and precision of both estimators. Estimators are then tested across
a range of scenarios representing implications of technical interactions
between species, and contrasts in data availability.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}

Each species in the DERPA complex is simulated using the model defined
in Table 2. Population dynamics are simulated by a simple biomass
dynamics process error-model (Figure 1.1, Eqs T2.2, T2.4), fishery
dependent catch is generated using fishing mortality as an input (Eq
T2.3) and fishery independent observations of catch per unit effort
(CPUE) are generated by the observation model (Figure 1.2, Eq T2.5).

Multispecies data produced by the simulation model are supplied to both
a Bayesian and frequentist version of a hierarchical state-space
assessment model (Figure 7). Both assessment models are specified in the
same way, shown in Table 3. The difference between the models is in how
the inferences are extended. For the Bayesian state space model the
posterior density (Eq. T3.8) is integrated over all parameters included
in \(\Theta\) (Eq T3.2) to produce marginal distributions for each
parameter (Gelman, Carlin, Stern, \& Rubin (2014)). For the frequentist
state space model, also known as a random effects model, the posterior
density is integrated over random effects (process errors) and prior
distributions to produce a marginal ``true'' likelihood, which is then
maximised as in traditional likelihood methods (de Valpine \& Hastings
(2002)).

Both models require an integration method to produce marginal
distributions or likelihoods (de Valpine \& Hastings (2002); Gelman et
al. (2014), Maunder, Deriso, \& Hanson (2015)). Integration generally
requires numerical methods like Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms for distribution sampling of complex non-linear, non-Gaussian
statistical models. To this end, the Bayesian model is coded using the
Automatic Differentiation Model Builder (ADMB) suite (Fournier et al.
(2012)) and the random effects model using Template Model Builder
(Kristensen, Nielsen, Berg, Skaug, \& Bell (2015)). Both software
packages provide fast numerical integration to produce marginal
distributions, with TMB being developed specifically for models
utilising a large number of random effects.

Model testing proceeds through four experimental scenarios that modify
simulation input parameters representing multispecies interactions and
data limitations. Parameter estimates from each trial are then compared
to their true values generated by the simulator to estimate bias and
precision of the models in each scenario.

The first two scenarios investigate model assumptions about process
error deviations \(\epsilon_{t}, \zeta_t\) and species catchability
coefficients \(q_s\). Both parameters are representive of interactions
between species in the complex. For example, species that share the same
habitat will encounter the same environmental variation, reflected in
coastwide process error deviations \(\epsilon_t\) (A. E. Punt et al.
(2011)). Moreover, interactions between each of the species may cause
correlations in their species speficic process errors \(\zeta_t\),
reflected in the covariane matrix \(\Sigma\). Similarly, species that
are fished by the same gear may have similar interactions with fishing
gear leading to correlations in catchability \(q_s\).

Shared priors are defined for process error deviations (Eqs T3.7, T3.8)
and catchability parameters (Eq T3.9). Bias and precision are measured
for a range of fixed values of the prior variance
(\(\sigma^2, \kappa^2 \in (0,\infty)\)) (Gelman et al. (2014), Ch 5.5)
and multiple configurations of the covariance matrix \(\Sigma\).

The remaining two scenarios contrast information available from survey
observations and resource responses to exploitation pressure.
Observation error is a direct measurement of the quality of data
obtained by scientific surveys, so contrasts in observation error
variance \(\tau_s^2\) simulate differing levels of data availability
between species in an assemblage. Fishery development histories,
characterised by fishing mortality \(F_{s,t}\) trajectories (Figure 8),
are a source of information based on the way a fish population responds
to changes in fishing pressure (Hilborn \& Walters (1992), Ch 2).

\subsection{Expected Results}\label{expected-results}

I expect this chapter to result in a working knowledge of how
hierarchical stock assessment models change the estimates of abundance
and productivity when applied to multispecies assemblages. Estimates of
model bias and precision as functions of correlation strengths,
observation error variance and historical fishing are produced. Results
are to be published in a paper about the statistical properties of 2
hierarchical multispecies assessment models.

Assumptions about the strength of correlations in shared parameters are
likely to introduce bias through shrinkage towards a mean (Mueter,
Peterman, \& Pyper (2002)). The extent of the shrinkage introduced can
be understood by producing bias and precision estimates under a range of
fixed values of shared prior variance.

The extent to which limitations on data and species specific information
can be overcome (A. E. Punt et al. (2011)), if at all, can be quantified
through bias and precision estimates resulting from scenarios
contrasting data-availability and fishing histories. This is especially
helpful for fisheries in which there are limited historical fishing and
scientific data available, or limited resources for improving existing
scientific surveys.

\section{Chapter 2: Adding Spatial Multistock Structure to Multispecies
Hierarchical Stock Assessment
Models}\label{chapter-2-adding-spatial-multistock-structure-to-multispecies-hierarchical-stock-assessment-models}

\subsection{Background}\label{background-2}

A high degree of spatial variation in genetics, morphology, life-history
and behaviour is apparent in many exploited fish populations (Hilborn,
Quinn, Schindler, \& Rogers (2003); Schindler et al. (2010)). Management
of exploited fishes without acknowledgement of this variation risks
eroding biodiversity and increasing species vulnerability to
environmental variation (Hilborn et al. (2003); Cope \& Punt (2011);
Benson et al. (2015)).

Aggregation of sub-stocks into a single management unit over large
spatial scales relies on assumed rescue effects that do not exist in
general multistock fisheries. The assumption is that despite spatial
disaggregation of the stock, sub-stocks are connected by migration
creating a rescue effect (Dulvy, Sadovy, \& Reynolds (2003)). Rescue
effects are then believed to reduce the risks of managing spatially
complex species in a single aggregate (Cope \& Punt (2011)). However,
this rescue effect is highly dependent on dispersal and recruitment
patterns in the meta-population and individual natural mortality rates
of sub-stocks (Benson et al. (2015)).

When stock structure is easily identified, as with Pacific salmon, there
are advantages to managing a species at the level of individual stocks.
For example, by estimating productivity levels for 43 individual stocks
of Pink salmon the effects of local variation in sea surface temperature
could be discovered (Su et al. (2004)). Furthermore, estimating
individual productivity levels within a management complex reduces the
risk of overfishing weak stocks whose productivity is less than the
aggregate's (Figure 2).

Managing multistock populations also has its challenges. When the exact
nature and connectedness of the spatial stock structure is unknown, it
is unclear whether or not aggregation is the more precautionary
management approach (Benson et al. (2015)). Furthermore, for a
data-limited species further disaggregation of the data will only
deplete the quantity of data available in each strata at the finer
resolution, raising further barriers to assessment.

A hierarchical stock assessment model may overcome data limitations from
disaggregation when managing for multiple stocks in a multispecies
fishery (A. E. Punt et al. (2011)). Life histories within species are
likely to be similar, allowing for prior distributions on life history
parameters that are shared between stocks. Similarly, sub-stocks of
multiple species share habitat and experience the same environmental
variation, allowing for a local spatial effect on process error
(Kallianiotis, Vidoris, \& Sylaios (2004)).

\textbf{QUESTION:} How do estimates of abundance and productivity in a
multistock, multispecies hierarchical model compare to those of a
coastwide multispecies hierarchical model?

The DERPA complex exhibits evidence of sub-stock structure. For example,
the species population of English sole on the British Columbia coast is
managed as two segregated major stocks with limited migration (Hart,
Clemens, \& others (1973)). Simulated data from a multi-stock model of
the DERPA complex is provided to both a coastwide and multistock
hierarchical multispecies model. Both models produce parameter
estimates, and bias and precision are compared.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods-1}

The DERPA complex is simulated as individual stocks \(p\) of each
species \(s\) (Table 5), with stocks corresponding to the discrete
populations identified in stock previous stock assessments (J. Fargo
(1999); Starr (070AD); Starr (2009); DFO (2015); K. R. Holt et al.
(2016)) (Figure 11). Migration from stock \(p\) to stock \(p'\) within
species \(s\) is possible with net migration rate \(\phi_{s,p,p'}\),
making stock population dynamics interdependent (Eq T5.4).

Population dynamics are affected by environmental process errors with
three components. The first component \(\epsilon_t\) affects all
populations identically. The second component \(\zeta_t\) affects stocks
within species identically, and between species according to the
covariance matrix \(\Sigma^{(S)}\). Finally, the third component
\(\xi_t\) is stock specific, with draws correlated according to the
covarance matrix \(\Sigma^{(P)}\). The stock specific component is meant
to capture spatial covariation between stocks of different species that
share the same habitat.

The multistock estimation procedure has three layers of hierarchical
structure to include multiple species, each containing multiple stocks
(Figure 9). The multiple stocks within each species share prior
distributions on growth \(r\) and catchability \(q\) parameters at the
species level (Figure 9(b); Eqs T6.7, T6.8). The multistock prior mean
catchabilities at the species level then share a multispecies prior
(Figure 9(c); Eq T6.10). Additionally, the process error components are
shared at the appropriate level (Eqs T6.9, T6.11, T6.12).

Five experimental scenarios are designed to evaluate bias and precision
of the multistock estimator as functions of data quality contrasts,
fishery development history and covariation due to shared environment.
Four scenarios are extended from Chapter 1 to account for increased
depth in the assemblage structure, including covaration between species
in \(\Sigma^{(S)}\) and covariation between stocks in \(\Sigma^{(P)}\).
The additional scenario models increased data-limitation introduced by
disaggregating an already data-limited species into multiple stocks.
Disaggregation could lead to increased observation error variance or
entirely missing observations for some stocks.

Finally, the multistock estimator is compared to the coastwide estimator
in Table 3. The coastwide model uses aggregated data from the multistock
simulator, and the 5 scenarios of the previous paragraph are repeated.
Bias and precision are recorded and compared between estimators.

\subsection{Expected Results}\label{expected-results-1}

I expect this chapter to deepen understanding of hierarchical estimators
and their application in a multistock context. Adding stock structure
involves increased model complexity and reduced data availability due to
disaggregation, introducing a tradeoff. This tradeoff is then evaluated
by varying data availability and model complexity and examining how
model bias and precision change for the coastwide and multistock models.
A publication detailing the tradeoffs between bias and precision under
different model structures is expected to result from this analysis.

\section{Chapter 3: Management Performance of Hierarchical Multispecies
Assessment
Models}\label{chapter-3-management-performance-of-hierarchical-multispecies-assessment-models}

\subsection{Background}\label{background-3}

Fisheries management procedures extend beyond the stock assessment model
(Figure 1). Stock assessment output (Figure 1.3) informs a decision rule
(Figure 1.4) that determines the amount of fishing effort expended to
collect the harvest quota (Figure 1.5). This effort dynamically impacts
fish populations and their habitat (Figure 1.1), providing feedback in
the form of new data (Figure 1.2) that is used for assessment.

An important test for an assessment model is how it performs as part of
a feedback management procedure. Management procedures include harvest
strategies, which are input or output controls on the fishery (Hilborn
\& Walters (1992), Ch. 15) and decision rules that scale controls to
stock status. Management procedures made up of decision rules, harvest
strategies and assessment models represent the full management cycle of
a fishery.

In this chapter, I use closed loop simulation to test management
procedures based on hierarchical multispecies stock assessment models.
Closed loop simulation modeling explicitly quantifies feedback in a
dynamic system (de la Mare (1998); Sainsbury, Punt, \& Smith (2000)). In
a fisheries management context, the closed loop includes the management
procedure, fish stocks and commercial and scientific data in a feedback
loop (Figure 9). The fishery, population dynamics and scientific survey
are part an operating model (M. L. Jones et al. (2009)) that provide
data to the assessment model and harvest control rule as part of a
management procedure. Management procedure evaluation then proceeds by
experimentally adjusting operating model and assessment model parameters
and observing the emergent behaviour. In this way, potential risks of
management can be quantified under a given set of assumptions.

Realistic predictions about management procedure performance require a
complex operating model that can accurately reflect fishery history.
Historical exploitation patterns are dependent on the spatial
distribution of fishing effort, induced by targeting behaviour of
harvesters (Hilborn \& Walters (1987); Walters \& Bonfil (1999); Walters
\& Martell (2004) Ch. 9.3). Targeting behaviour is dependent on several
factors, including catch composition and expected financial reward, and
can be simulated by including a fishing effort dynamics model for
multiple fishing fleets (gear types) in the operating model. Effort
dynamics are based on fishery dependent catchability parameters
\(q_{f,s,t}\) (Table 7), which can be empirically estimated from
commercial data or parametrically simulated.

\textbf{QUESTION:} How do multispecies hierarchical assessment models
perform when managing multispecies assemblages containing data limited
stocks, with performance measured by probability of overfishing,
underfishing and variation in annual catch?

I answer this question by running closed loop simulations of the DERPA
complex under different management and ecological scenarios. A validated
operating model that accurately reflects historical fishery effort and
observed population dynamics is used to simulate management procedures
forward in time and assess risks of future management decisions. Risks
of assessment model errors, harvest control rules and effort dynamics
can be tested across multiple experimental operating model scenarios and
management. Experiments include contrasts in data-quality between
species, spatial aggregation of multistock structure, covariation due to
environmental forcing (Dichmont, Deng, Punt, Venables, \& Haddon
(2006)), and changes in effort dynamics brought about by changing costs
and benefits of fishing.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods-2}

The closed loop simulator of the DERPA complex requires an operating
model including effort dynamics (Table 7; M. L. Jones et al. (2009)). At
each time step \(t\), the current state of each fish stock or species is
estimated by the assessment model. Asessment models then forecast
abundance at time \(t+1\), which is passed through a harvest control
rule (HCR) to generate a total allowable catch (TAC) for each species.
The TAC for each species is then supplied to the operating model, which
distributes fishing effort across the space in order to maximise some
objective, such as profit, subject to the constraints of the TAC.

Four classes of model are available for simulating short term
distribution of fishing effort (Walters \& Martell (2004), Ch. 9.3).
From least to most complex the four classes are: gravity models (Walters
\& Bonfil (1999)), ideal free distribution (IFD) models (Benson et al.
(2015)), sequential effort allocation models (Hilborn \& Walters (1987))
and individual based models.

For spatial allocation of fishing effort I use a simplified IFD model
(Walters \& Bonfil (1999)) with a numerical effort response model for
fish vulnerability (Cox \& Walters (2002)) \textbf{INCLUDE MATH IN A
TABLE}. The IFD model is chosen because of the large spatial scale of
discrete stocks in the DERPA complex (Figure 11), allowing for the more
complex IFD model over the simplified gravity model more suited to finer
resolution. The numerical effort response model allows for the
transition of individuals to and from a vulnerable state, reflecting the
reality that not all habitat can be fished by all gear.

External economic forces are included as part of the effort dynamics
model. The IFD model ranks the quality of each fishing site by the
profitability \(pr_i\) of fishing at site \(i\). Profitability is a
function of fishing cost (fuel, deckhands, catch handling), ex-vessel
sale price of catch and the price to acquire necessary quota for
bycatch. Quota prices are subject to market forces, such as scarcity,
meaning bycatch quota for pinch-point species can at times exceed the
ex-vessel sale price of that species (\textbf{REFERENCE??}), decreasing
the expected profitability of a given site and affecting harvester
behaviour.

The closed loop simulation tests future performance of management
procedures using single species, coastwide multispecies and multistock
multispecies models in experimental scenarios. Experiments test a range
of observation error variances, process error variances, fishery
development history and correlations in catchability \(q_{s,j,t}\). Each
simulation measures quota utilisation, species depletion, probability of
exceeding optimal instantaneous fishing mortality and annual average
variation. Simulation output is then used to compare between scenarios
and management procedures, quantifying performance and risks of each
procedure.

\subsection{Expected Results}\label{expected-results-2}

This chapter is expected to result an understanding of how hierarchical
management procedures perform in multispecies fisheries. Performance of
both coastwide and multistock models is compared in closed loop
simulation against the status quo management of the DERPA complex, which
involves intermittent assessments at best. Furthermore, simulations of
the DERPA complex status quo management may uncover risks unconsidered
in the current management system.

Results are to be published in at least one article in the primary
literature. The effort dynamics are expected to combine with
multispecies catch and quota allocation to produce emergent pinch-point
effects within the management system leading to underfishing of some
species, forming the basis of one article. Depending on the novelty and
complexity of the market forces influencing the IFD effort dynamics
simulator, a second article may be warranted.

\section{Chapter 4: Avoiding non-target
species.}\label{chapter-4-avoiding-non-target-species.}

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}

Quota on directed species in the BCIGF is constrained by restrictive
quotas on pinch-point species and size limits on directed species, both
of which are caught incidentally during directed fishing. For example,
an average of 160 tonnes per year of Sablefish below 55cm in length were
discarded due to size regulations by trap and trawl fishing vessels
between 2007 and 2015 in the BCIGF \textbf{SOURCE: GFFOS}.

There is general agreement in the literature that incidental catch and
discarding should be reduced as much as possible or practical (Saila \&
Jones (1983); Crowder \& Murawski (1998); Safina \& Lewison (2008); Pelc
et al. (2015)). Mortality of immature individuals caused by unregulated
or regulated (i.e.~size, quota, trip limits) discarding contributes to
both recruitment and growth overfishing of fish stocks (Crowder \&
Murawski (1998)). Furthermore, bycatch has an impact on the ecosystem
containing the target resource, including all non-resource species and
habitats that interact with the fishing gear (Safina \& Lewison (2008)).

In this chapter I test the feasibility of using a model-based approach
to predicting fishing events that encounter and discard juvenile
sablefish by analysing commercial fishing data for the purposes of
avoiding regulatory discarding. Data generated by commercial fishing is
not randomly sampled, so traditional statistical models that rely on the
central limit theorem are unsuitable. Instead, machine learning models
are used to sidestep statistical assumptions and search for correlations
in the data (C. M. Bishop (2006); T. Hastie et al. (2009)).

Three machine learning models are trained and optimised on a subset of
commercial data from the BCIGF to classify presence and absence of
juvenile sablefish for a given fishing event. Event predictions from all
three models are then combined into an ensemble classifier (Rokach
(2010)). Ensemble classifiers use weighted model averaging techniques to
overcome potential overfitting to the training data. The remaining data
is then used to test the performance of the ensemble classifier using
multiple metrics (Freeman \& Moisen (2008))

The feasibility of a tool to avoid regulatory discarding requires an
economic benefit to harvesters. Because juvenile Sablefish are discarded
under size regulations, no discard induced mortality is deducted from
harvester quota (Fisheries and Oceans, Canada (2015)). No reduction in
quota implies a lack of economic incentive for harvesters to avoid
conditions that lead to the catch of juvenile fish.

\textbf{QUESTION:} What is the benefit of using a machine learning
approach for predicting the presence and absence of juvenile sablefish
in commercial fishing events, compared to the status quo?

Economic benefit of the ensemble classifier is measured by estimating
the value of information provided by the classifier (Mäntyniemi, Kuikka,
Rahikainen, Kell, \& Kaitala (2009)). Classifier performance is combined
with empirical estimates of the probability of encounter in a decision
analysis, with utility provided by a dollar value based on the costs and
benefits of successful and unsuccessful avoidance.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods-3}

Predictive capacity of an ensemble machine learning classifier to detect
juvenile Sablefish is tested on 4 sets of commercial fishing data from
the BCIGF. The BCIGF data is contained in the Groundfish Fishery
Operating System (GFFOS) data base that contains spatially and
temporally explicit data for every fishing event in the BCIGF since
2005. The 4 data sets are split by gear type, with data sets containing
events using (i) trawl only, (ii) longline trap only, (iii) longline
hook only and (iv) all gear types.

For each data set, an ensemble classifier is built from Random Forest
(Breiman (2001)), Naive Bayes (ref) and Artificial Neural Network (ref)
component classifiers. Component classifier configurations are chosen
based on average performance over Monte-Carlo trials of a validation
procedure (T. Hastie et al. (2009), Ch 7.2). Performance of classifiers
is measured using multiple metrics including percentage correctly
classified, area under receiver operating characteristic curves,
precision and recall (Freeman \& Moisen (2008)). Component classifiers
that perform the best are then combined into an ensemble using multiple
configurations, ranging from simple model stacking to Bayesian Model
combination (Rokach (2010)). Ensemble classifiers are then tested on a
reserved portion of the data to estimate the classification error rate
of the ensemble.

A formal decision analysis is performed to estimate the value of
information provided by using the classifier with the lowest error rate
on each data set (Mäntyniemi et al. (2009); Peterman \& Anderson (1999);
Pestes, Peterman, Bradford, \& Wood (2008)). Classifiers are included in
the analysis as a form of expert opinion, adjusting the probability of
encountering juvenile Sablefish given a message from the classifier. The
value of information is then the difference in the expected utility of
fishing with the classifier's help and the expected utility of fishing
without it. The utility is dependent on the costs setting gear and
sorting discards from the catch, as well as the value of landed catch.

\subsection{Expected Results}\label{expected-results-3}

It is expected that machine learning will be economically feasible for
the avoidance of non-target species. However, the net benefit is
expected to depend on the nature of the species being avoided. For
example, pinch-point species with restrictive quota that is costly to
acquire, such as Yelloweye rockfish, may result in a greater net
benefit, while regulatory discards of juvenile individuals with no quota
penalty may result in a lesser net benefit.

Challenges in this chapter include acquiring spatially and temporally
explicit data for bycatch of juvenile sablefish, and estimating the
costs and benefits for the decision analysis. For data acquisition, the
privacy act creates a limit on the resolution of commercial data,
requiring creativity an perspiration in choosing an aggregation scale.
Estimates of the costs and benefits of fishing may exist in the
literature for other fisheries, but this may be best informed by asking
skippers directly.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

This thesis is a study of assessment and avoidance tools that may
improve management of integrated multispecies fisheries, in which
technical interactions cause constraints on fishery profitability.
Profitability is constrained when the effort targeting directed, high
value species encounters non-target species with restrictive quota.
Restrictive species quota may be caused by data limitations precluding
regular assessments, or conservation concerns requiring rebuilding
strategies. In either case, those species become pinch-points on the
efficient management of the fishery.

Hierarchical assessment models studied in Chapters 1, 2 and 3 may
overcome data limitations and allow assessments to be extended to
species that were previously unassessed. Extending assessments to
previously unassessed species may or may not relieve pinch points by
reducing uncertainty about stock status, but will always increase
scientific defensibilty. Indeed, up-to-date and regular assessments of
non-target species allows for improved ratings by eco-certification
bodies (Driscoll (2014)). Improved eco-certification then creates follow
on benefits by improving access to foreign and domestic markets,
increasing market share of the fishery.

Closed loop simulations of hierarchical assessment models studied in
Chapter 3 may have further benefits in multispecies fishery management,
specifically in improving the allocation of scientific resources. By
assessing groups of multiple species with similar life and evolutionary
histories, it may be possible to take biological samples more
efficiently. For example, age and length sampling may occur only for
higher value species in a group, with lower value species sampled for
length only. Then length and age can be related through a shared
multispecies prior defined in the hierarchical assessment model. If
model stability is an issue, low frequency age sampling of the lower
value species may be necessary. Closed loop simulation can assess the
potential risks associated with these and other survey design
modifications.

Avoidance techniques are necessary when assessment methods are unable to
relieve pinch-point effects of low quota species. The machine learning
methods studied in Chapter 4 are a novel approach to the avoidance
problem, combining technological and fleet communication approaches. A
centralised communication system can use reported observer data to
provide near-real-time information to harvesters, detailing the
probability of non-target species encounter under given conditions. The
system is not unique to juvenile Sablefish and could be extended to any
non-target species encountered, which would change the expected net
economic benefit of the product.
